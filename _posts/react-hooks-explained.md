React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components by allowing us to use state and lifecycle methods inside functional components.

## Common Hooks

- `useState`: Manage local state in functional components.
- `useEffect`: Perform side effects like data fetching.
- `useContext`: Access context values easily.

With hooks, we can create cleaner, more concise React components, making our code more maintainable.
