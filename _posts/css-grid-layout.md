CSS Grid Layout is a powerful tool for creating complex and responsive web designs with ease.

## Key Concepts

1. Grid Container: The element on which `display: grid` is applied.
2. Grid Items: The direct children of the grid container.
3. Grid Tracks: Rows and columns in the grid layout.

With Grid, you can build intricate layouts that adapt to various screen sizes without the need for complex media queries.
